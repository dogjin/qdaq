  * Make QDaqBuffer explicitly shared
  * Fix lib headers issue (i.e. core/QDaqObject or what??)
  * Syntax checking in scripts and report to user
  * Implement editing of QDaq Types in property browser. Need to subclass QtVariantEditorFactory.
    Current solution: properties are displayed read-only as a text string
