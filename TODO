  * load/save properties and file version, e.g. QDaqDataBuffer prop "type" changed. how to load from old file??
  * type marshalling in setQDaqProperty - handle special cases like ByteArray, Vector, etc...
  * History file to start with a .
  * Syntax checking in scripts and report to user
  * Implement editing of QDaq Types in property browser. Need to subclass QtVariantEditorFactory.
    Current solution: properties are displayed read-only as a text string
  * Session error log output should go also to stderr
  * qdaq errors should also go to stderr
  * when IDE is closed and opened after error, the error is not displayed
  * error queue object has to be updated
  * Syntax highlighting in console widgets
  * Ui window browser similar to QDaq object browser
